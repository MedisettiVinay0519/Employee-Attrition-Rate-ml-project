# üßë‚Äçüíº Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

This data science project addresses the critical business challenge of **employee turnover (attrition)**. Using Python and Machine Learning, the repository contains a comprehensive analysis aimed at understanding *why* employees leave and developing a model to **predict which employees are at the highest risk** of attrition.

The goal is to provide **actionable insights** for HR teams to implement targeted retention strategies, minimizing turnover costs and improving workforce stability.

## üöÄ Key Deliverables

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Deep dive into employee demographics, job roles, and satisfaction metrics to uncover patterns of attrition.
* **Feature Importance:** Determine which variables (e.g., Monthly Income, Overtime, Job Satisfaction) have the highest impact on attrition.
* **Predictive Model:** Implementation of a classification model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.
